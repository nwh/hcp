* <2012-01-31 Tue> hcp-arcopt-ipopt experiment summary

ARCOPT and IPOPT were applied to the HC problem on 4 new graphs provided by MH.
The graph data is located in hcp/graphs.  The following graphs were used:

- graph24.m: 24 node cubic graph
- graph30.m: 30 node cubic graph
- graph30degree4.m: 30 node graph, each node has degree 4
- graph38.m: 38 node cubic graph

Each HCP was tried 20 times from different starting points.  The first, denoted
1 in the result table, was the analytic center of the feasible region.  The
remaining 19 starting points where generated randomly.  Pseudo code showing the
starting point generation process follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC matlab
n; % number of edges, variables in problem
buf = .1; % small buffer to keep random values away from 0 and 1

v = (1-2*buf)*rand(n,1)+buf;

cvx_begin
variable x0(n);
minimize( sum_square(x0-v) );
subject to
  A*x == b;
  x >= 0;
  x <= 1;
cvx_end
#+END_SRC
