The experimental results are stored in sub dirs of results.  This file contains
some short notes describing the experiments.

** <2012-01-18 Wed> comparison between arcopt and ipopt on cubic graphs

All graphs supplied by Haythorpe and indicated as having a ham. cycle were run
with both arcopt and ipopt.

Individual graphs were given to hcp_arcopt.m and hcp_ipopt.m.  The drivers for
the experiment are drv_arcopt.m and drv_ipopt.m.

The resulting tables and summary were produced by drv_results.m

** <2012-01-25 Wed> separate results for 10, 12, and 14 node graphs

This experiment did two things:

- printed output for each solve of hcp_data with arcopt

- looked at the overall results for 10, 12, and 14 node graphs
