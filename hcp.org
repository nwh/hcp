** <2012-01-18 Wed> comparison between arcopt and ipopt on cubic graphs

All graphs supplied by Haythorpe and indicated as having a ham. cycle were run
with both arcopt and ipopt.

Individual graphs were given to hcp_arcopt.m and hcp_ipopt.m.  The drivers for
the experiment are drv_arcopt.m and drv_ipopt.m.

The resulting tables and summary were produced by drv_results.m
